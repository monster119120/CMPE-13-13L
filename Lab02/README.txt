Lab 2, Calculator

For this lab, I did not collaborate with any other students.
I spent the whole day on Monday (MLK day) to finish this lab.
Overall, it was not a hard lab; I was just stuck on implementing some parts
of the lab, such as the while loop that allows the user to input an operation 
and having the invalid operator message display correctly. I did fine overall 
with implementing the required operations, though I took longer figuring out how
to write the Round function than the others. I think one thing that should be
elaborated more is how scanf(); eats up whitespaces so that it is necessary to
add a space before the string starts in scanf to skip leading whitespace. I
also think there should be a little more elaboration on how Coolterm or any
other serial terminals work, particularly on how they process linefeeds.

Because we worked on coding these functions previously in Lab1, I wanted to
note that I reused the codes that convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
(and vice versa) and absolute value from Lab1 into Lab2.
